vuln104: "details": "(1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead. For more information checkout the CWE-338 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) advisory."

vuln106: "details": "(1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: MissConfiguration
      Use WORKDIR instead of proliferating instructions like 'RUN cd … && do-something', which are hard to read, troubleshoot, and maintain.
      Message: RUN should not be used to change directory: 'cd deps/node_modules/sharp && npm run install'. Use 'WORKDIR' statement instead.
      Resolution: Use WORKDIR to change directory

vuln107: "details": "(1/1) * Possible vulnerability detected: Having a permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy
Same origin policy in browsers prevents, by default and for security-reasons, a javascript frontend to perform a cross-origin HTTP request to a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own. The requested target can append additional HTTP headers in response, called CORS, that act like directives for the browser and change the access control policy / relax the same origin policy. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be set only for a trusted origin and for specific resources.
